# Collection Log KC
This plugin allows you to view the KC that you got a unique drop.
Note that this only works for uniques that are gotten after the plugin is installed
(unless Jagex decides to add a way to track before). I may add it to where you can
add your own KCs for items that were gotten before the plugin was installed.
